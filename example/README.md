# An example

This is an example program. It uses BGFX and GLFW together.

GLFW version required: 3.2

I've slipped some binaries in for Windows & OS X users. Linux users,
your package manager should have a decent version of GLFW there somewhere.

You probably can't get away with an older version of GLFW.

**OS X, Linux, Windows**: `luajit ./main.lua`
