CHANGES
=======

* Added e.g. glfw.GetX11* functions sufficient to get bgfx working
* Added glfw.GetWin32Window()
* Added glfw.GetX11Display()

All my changes assume the 64-bit version of the given operating system!

Param types (e.g. what length is a X11Window?) are my best guesses. Seems to work.
